SPGo allows you and your team to develop SharePoint web solutions from your local PC using the power of Visual Studio Code. Now you can build and customize SharePoint sites source-control first with all of the power of a top-tier IDE. 

SPGo is available directly from VSCode (Search SPGo in the extension pane), or from the project page on the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Goals
With SPGo, we will follow the "Lightweight" ethos of VSCode. To support this goal, we will always prioritize the developer experience and treat code files, source control, and simple SharePoint integration as our top priorities. To us, this means working from your local environment to author clean, readable code, in an development IDE that you and your team are already familiar with.

Of equal importance to compelling functionality, is keeping this project Open Source. Our source code is published under MIT licence on GitHub and we welcome external feedback, and pull requests.

## Features
#### AUTOMATICALLY DEPLOY OR PUBLISH FILES TO SHAREPOINT ON SAVE
SPGo can persist changes in your local workspace directly to SharePoint. Use the file pane integration or hotkeys to check out a file from SharePoint, make changes, and then publish a minor or major version.

#### COMPARE LOCAL FILES WITH SHAREPOINT USING VSCODE COMPARE
Any time you check a file out from SharePoint, SPGo will compare the latest server version of that file to your local copy - any differences will be displayed in the native VSCode Compare Window. Additionally, you can compare your local copy of a file with the server copy from the file pane at any time.

#### SYNCHRONIZE REMOTE FILES AND FOLDERS TO YOUR LOCAL WORKSPACE
Quickly download any available files from SharePoint to populate your local workspace, including WebPart files, Master Pages, html, CSS, and JavaScript files, or even images and documents.

#### AUTHOR CLEAN, READABLE CODE
VSCode is the premier cross-platform text editor, and supports the latest in code editing and code-management features and is designed for the web. SPGo brings this first-class IDE to SharePoint projects.

#### KEEP ALL PROJECT CONFIGURATION IN SOURCE CONTROL FOR EASY TEAM INTEGRATION
Because you work from your local file system, integration with your source control management tool of choice is easy (and probably already supported by VSCode). Gone are the days of difficult asset tracking, or forcing everyone to share a single SharePoint environment. 

#### Documentation
We host extensive usage notes, tips, and tutorials on our documentation site.

## What Else?
We created SPGo because we wanted a better development experience for the projects we deliver in-house. We also know that we rely heavily on the open-source community for tooling and support in our day-to-day professional (and personal) lives, which made sharing this tool with the community a primary driver. We welcome feedback, assistance and pull requests.
