This series covers the details of how to complete a VSCode Extension. Microsoft already provides great documentation on how to code an extension at their [documentation site](https://code.visualstudio.com/api). The intent is not to duplicate that work, but to provide guidance on how to get that hosted on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).

The source of this is spgo

I have broken this down into 6 different areas, which are linked below.
