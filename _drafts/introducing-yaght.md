Yet another Github Template (yaght) is a GitHub-friendly personal Jekyll theme for developers. It is based on the default minima theme and it powers this website. You can demo it [here](https://www.chrishasz.com/yaght-demo/).

## Goals

I built yaght with a goal of simplifying the process of getting a personal site off the ground. The Goal is a simple template that would automatically provide features like multiple blog and page templates to control the layout, easy setup of critical SEO optimization for reach, and automated integration with your GitHub projects. I have always liked the simplicity of [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) but wanted more robust blogging features, additional page templates, and GitHub integration.

## Features

### GITHUB PROJECT INTEGRATION
